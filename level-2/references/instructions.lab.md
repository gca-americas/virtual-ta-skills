>make sure you do `deactivate` before moving forward.


👉💻 In the terminal, Make the init script executable and run it:

```bash
cd ~/way-back-home/level_2
./init.sh
```

> aside positive
> **⚠️ Note on Project ID:**
> The script will prompt you to create a new Google Cloud Project. You can accept the default randomly generated Project ID or specify your own.

### 2. Configure Project

👉💻 Set your project ID:

```bash
gcloud config set project $(cat ~/project_id.txt) --quiet
```

👉💻 Enable required APIs (this takes ~2-3 minutes):

```bash
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com \
                       aiplatform.googleapis.com \
                       run.googleapis.com \
                       cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
                       artifactregistry.googleapis.com \
                       spanner.googleapis.com \
                       storage.googleapis.com
```

### 3. Run Setup Script

👉💻 Execute the setup script:

```bash
cd ~/way-back-home/level_2
./setup.sh
```

This will create `.env` for you. In your cloudshell, open `way_back_home`project. Under `level_2` folder, you can see `.env` file is created for you. If you cannot find it, you can click `View` -> `Toggle Hidden File` to see it.
![open_project](img/open_project.png)

### 4. Load Sample Data

👉💻 Navigate to backend and install dependencies:

```bash
cd ~/way-back-home/level_2/backend
uv sync
```

👉💻 Load initial survivor data:

```bash
uv run python ~/way-back-home/level_2/backend/setup_data.py
```
This creates:
- Spanner instance (`survivor-network`)
- Database (`graph-db`)
- All node and edge tables
- Property graphs for querying
**Expected output**:

```
============================================================
SUCCESS! Database setup complete.
============================================================

Instance:  survivor-network
Database:  graph-db
Graph:     SurvivorGraph

Access your database at:

## 🚀 Visualizing Graph Data in Spanner Studio
**Duration: 5 min**

This guide helps you visualize and interact with the Survivor Network graph data directly in the Google Cloud Console using Spanner Studio. This is a great way to verify your data and understand the graph structure before building your AI agent.

### 1. Access Spanner Studio

1. In the last step, make sure you click the link and open the Spanner Studio.

![spanner_studio](img/spanner_studio_open.png)


### 2. Understanding Graph Structure (The "Big Picture")

Think of the Survivor Network dataset as a logic puzzle or a **Game State**:

| Entity | Role in the System | Analogy |
|--------|--------------------|---------|
| **Survivors** | The agents/players | Players |
| **Biomes** | Where they are located | Map Zones |
| **Skills** | What they can *do* | Abilities |
| **Needs** | What they *lack* (Crises) | Quests/Missions |
| **Resources** | Items found in the world | Loot |

**The Goal**: The AI agent's job is to connect **Skills** (Solutions) to **Needs** (Problems), considering **Biomes** (Location constraints).

**🔗 Edges (Relationships):**
- `SurvivorInBiome`: Location tracking
- `SurvivorHasSkill`: Inventory of abilities
- `SurvivorHasNeed`: List of active problems
- `SurvivorFoundResource`: Inventory of items
- `SurvivorCanHelp`: **Inferred** relationship (The AI calculates this!)

### 3. Querying the Graph

Let's run a few queries to see the "Story" in the data.

Spanner Graph uses **GQL (Graph Query Language)**. To run a query, use `GRAPH SurvivorNetwork` followed by your match pattern.

👉 **Query 1: The Global Roster (Who is where?)**
This is your foundation - understanding **location** is critical for rescue operations.

```sql
GRAPH SurvivorNetwork
MATCH result = (s:Survivors)-[:SurvivorInBiome]->(b:Biomes)
RETURN TO_JSON(result) AS json_result
```

Expect to see result as below:
![query1](img/query1.png)

>aside positive
>**Why this matters:**
>- **For Dispatchers**: You can't send someone from the Volcanic zone to rescue someone in the Cryo zone.
>- **For the AI Agent**: When a user asks *"Who's in the forest?"*, this is the query pattern the agent uses.
>- **Visualization**: You'll see 4 survivors spread across 4 biomes - this is your "map view".

---

👉 **Query 2: The Skill Matrix (Capabilities)**
Now that you know **where** everyone is, find out **what they can do**.

```sql
GRAPH SurvivorNetwork
MATCH result = (s:Survivors)-[h:SurvivorHasSkill]->(k:Skills)
RETURN TO_JSON(result) AS json_result
```

Expect to see result as below:
![query2](img/query2.png)

>aside positive
>**Why this matters:**
>- **For Dispatchers**: Identify your medics, engineers, and navigators at a glance.
>- **For the AI Agent**: When a user asks *"Who knows first aid?"*, this query finds them.
>- **Proficiency Levels**: Notice the edge `h` has a `proficiency` property (expert/proficient/basic) - the graph stores relationship metadata!

---

👉 **Query 3: Who is in Crisis? (The "Mission Board")**
See the survivors who need help and what they need.

```sql
GRAPH SurvivorNetwork
MATCH result = (s:Survivors)-[h:SurvivorHasNeed]->(n:Needs)
RETURN TO_JSON(result) AS json_result
```

Expect to see result as below:
![query3](img/query3.png)

>aside positive
>**Why this matters:**
>- **For Dispatchers**: Prioritize rescue missions by urgency.
>- **For the AI Agent**: This is the "to-do list" - these are the problems waiting to be solved.

---

#### 🔎 [Optional] Matchmaking - Who Can Help Whom?

This is where the graph becomes powerful! This query finds **survivors who have skills that can treat other survivors' needs**.

```sql
GRAPH SurvivorNetwork
MATCH result = (helper:Survivors)-[:SurvivorHasSkill]->(skill:Skills)-[:SkillTreatsNeed]->(need:Needs)<-[:SurvivorHasNeed]-(helpee:Survivors)
RETURN TO_JSON(result) AS json_result
```

Expect to see result as below:
![query4](img/query4.png)

aside positive
**What This Query Does:**

Instead of just showing "First Aid treats burns" (which is obvious from the schema), this query finds:
- **Dr. Elena Frost** (who has Medical Training) → can treat → **Captain Tanaka** (who has burns)
- **David Chen** (who has First Aid) → can treat → **Lt. Park** (who has a sprained ankle)

**Why This Is Powerful:**

> aside positive
> **The Graph Advantage**: This is a 4-hop traversal:
>
> 1. Start with a Helper (Survivor)
> 2. Find their Skills
> 3. Match those Skills to Needs they treat
> 4. Find the Survivors who have those Needs
>
> **Without a graph**, you'd need to:
> - Query SurvivorHasSkill table → get skills
> - Query SkillTreatsNeed table → find which needs match
> - Query SurvivorHasNeed table → find who has those needs
> - Join all the results in application code
>
> **With Spanner Graph**, it's a single query that the database optimizes for you.

**What Your AI Agent Will Do:**

When a user asks *"Who can treat burns?"*, the agent will:
1. Run a similar graph query
2. Return: **"Dr. Frost has Medical Training and can help Captain Tanaka"**
3. The user doesn't need to know about intermediate tables or relationships!

## 🚀 AI-Powered Embeddings in Spanner
**Duration: 8 min**

### 1. Why Embeddings? (No action, read only)

In the survival scenario, **time is critical**. When a survivor reports an emergency, like `I need someone who can treat burns` or `Looking for a medic`, they can't waste time guessing exact skill names in the database.

>aside positive
>**The Problem with Traditional Search**:
>- **Exact Matching**: A keyword search for "medic" won't find "Medical Training" or "First Aid"
>- **Vocabulary Mismatch**: Survivors might say "doctor", "healer", "paramedic" but the database stores formal skill names
>- **Context Loss**: "treat burns" should find both "Medical Training" AND "First Aid", but simple text search won't understand the semantic relationship
>
>**The Solution: Semantic Search with Embeddings**:
>Embeddings convert text into **768-dimensional vectors** that capture **meaning**, not just spelling. Similar concepts cluster together in vector space, so "medic" naturally finds "Medical Training" even with zero word overlap.


**Real Scenario**:
Survivor: `Captain Tanaka has burns—we need medical help NOW!`
 
Traditional keyword search for "medic" → 0 results ❌

Semantic search with embeddings → Finds "Medical Training", "First Aid" ✅

This is exactly what agents need: **intelligent, human-like search** that understands intent, not just keywords.

>aside positive
>**Why Spanner?**:
>Instead of exporting data to Python, generating embeddings externally, and re-importing them (slow, error-prone), Spanner's **ML.PREDICT** lets you:
>- Generate embeddings **directly in SQL** using Vertex AI models
>- Store vectors **alongside graph data** (no separate vector database)
>- Perform **semantic search queries** in real-time during graph traversals
>
>This creates a powerful **Graph RAG** system: graph relationships (who has what skill) + semantic search (find skills by meaning) = intelligent agent queries.

---

### 2. Create Embedding Model

>aside positive 
>**What is ML.PREDICT?**
>
>`ML.PREDICT` is Spanner's built-in function that lets you call machine learning models **directly from SQL**—no Python, no export/import, no separate services. Think of it as bridging your database and Vertex AI in real-time.
>
>**How it works**:
>1. You create a **virtual model** in Spanner (just a reference, no model weights stored locally)
>2. When you use `ML.PREDICT(model, data)` in a query, Spanner sends your data to Vertex AI via API
>3. Vertex AI processes it and returns results **as columns** in your SQL result
>
>**Why this is powerful**:
>- ✅ **Zero-ETL**: Process data where it lives—no exporting to Python scripts
>- ✅ **Real-time**: Generate embeddings or LLM responses on-the-fly during queries
>- ✅ **Scalable**: Spanner handles the orchestration, Vertex AI handles the compute

![spanner_embedding](img/spanner_embedding.png)

Now let's create a model that converts text into embeddings using Google's `text-embedding-004`.

---

👉 In Spanner Studio, run this SQL (replace `$YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual project id):

> aside negative
> Make sure to replace `$YOUR_PROJECT_ID`
> You can find your actual project id in your .env file

‼️ In Cloud shell **editor**, open `File` -> `Open Folder` -> `way-back-home/level_2`
to see the whole project.

![project_id](img/project_id.png)

👉 Run this query in Spanner Studio by copy and paste the query below, and then click Run button:
```sql
CREATE MODEL TextEmbeddings
INPUT(content STRING(MAX))
OUTPUT(embeddings STRUCT<values ARRAY<FLOAT32>>)
REMOTE OPTIONS (
    endpoint = '//aiplatform.googleapis.com/projects/$YOUR_PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1/publishers/google/models/text-embedding-004'
);
```

> aside negative
> If you forget to replace `$YOUR_PROJECT_ID` and already run it, 
> make sure to do `DROP MODEL TextEmbeddings;` before you retry it.

**What This Does**:
- Creates a **virtual model** in Spanner (no model weights stored locally)
- Points to Google's `text-embedding-004` on Vertex AI
- Defines the contract: Input is text, output is a 768-dimension float array

**Why "REMOTE OPTIONS"?**
- Spanner doesn't run the model itself
- It calls Vertex AI via API when you use `ML.PREDICT`
- **Zero-ETL**: No need to export data to Python, process, and re-import


Click `Run` button, once it's succeed, you can see the result as below:

![spanner_result](img/query_result_1.png)

> aside positive
> This creates a "virtual model" that references Vertex AI's text-embedding-004. No data leaves Spanner—it's called via API.

### 3. Add Embedding Column

👉 Add a column to store embeddings:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Skills ADD COLUMN skill_embedding ARRAY<FLOAT32>;
```

Click `Run` button, once it's succeed, you can see the result as below:

![embedding_result](img/embedding_result.png)

### 4. Generate Embeddings

👉 Use AI to create vector embeddings for each skill:

```sql
UPDATE Skills
SET skill_embedding = (
    SELECT embeddings.values
    FROM ML.PREDICT(
        MODEL TextEmbeddings,
        (SELECT name AS content)
    )
)
WHERE skill_embedding IS NULL;
```

Click `Run` button, once it's succeed, you can see the result as below:

![skills_result](img/skills_result.png)

> aside negative
> if you see the permission error, please redo step 2 **create embedding model**. make sure to do `DROP MODEL TextEmbeddings;` before you retry it.

**What happens**: Each skill name (e.g., "first aid") is converted to a 768-dimension vector representing its semantic meaning.

### 5. Verify Embeddings

👉 Check that embeddings were created:

```sql
SELECT 
    skill_id,
    name,
    ARRAY_LENGTH(skill_embedding) AS embedding_dimensions
FROM Skills
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected output**:

![spanner_result](img/query_result_2.png)

### 6. Test Semantic Search

**Now we test the exact use case from our scenario**: finding medical skills using the term "medic".

👉 Find skills similar to "medic":

```sql
WITH query_embedding AS (
    SELECT embeddings.values AS val
    FROM ML.PREDICT(MODEL TextEmbeddings, (SELECT "medic" AS content))
)
SELECT
    s.name AS skill_name,
    s.category,
    COSINE_DISTANCE(s.skill_embedding, (SELECT val FROM query_embedding)) AS distance
FROM Skills AS s
WHERE s.skill_embedding IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY distance ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

- Converts user's search term "medic" into an embedding
- Stores it in the `query_embedding` temporary table

**Expected results** (lower distance = more similar):

![spanner_result](img/query_result_3.png)

### 7. Create Gemini Model for Analysis

![spanner_gemini](img/spanner_gemini.png)

👉 Create a generative AI model reference (replace `$YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual project id):

> aside negative
> Make sure to replace `$YOUR_PROJECT_ID`
> You can find your actual project id in your .env file

```sql
CREATE MODEL GeminiPro
INPUT(prompt STRING(MAX))
OUTPUT(content STRING(MAX))
REMOTE OPTIONS (
    endpoint = '//aiplatform.googleapis.com/projects/$YOUR_PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1/publishers/google/models/gemini-2.5-pro',
    default_batch_size = 1
);
```

> aside negative
> If you forget to replace `$YOUR_PROJECT_ID` and already run it, > make sure to do `DROP MODEL GeminiPro;` before you retry it.

**Difference from Embeddings Model**:
- **Embeddings**: Text → Vector (for similarity search)
- **Gemini**: Text → Generated Text (for reasoning/analysis)

![spanner_result](img/query_result_4.png)


### 8. Use Gemini for Compatibility Analysis

👉 Analyze survivor pairs for mission compatibility:

```sql
WITH PairData AS (
    SELECT
        s1.name AS Name_A,
        s2.name AS Name_B,
        CONCAT(
            "Assess compatibility of these two survivors for a resource-gathering mission. ",
            "Survivor 1: ", s1.name, ". ",
            "Survivor 2: ", s2.name, ". ",
            "Give a score from 1-10 and a 1-sentence reason."
        ) AS prompt
    FROM Survivors s1
    JOIN Survivors s2 ON s1.survivor_id < s2.survivor_id
    LIMIT 1
)
SELECT
    Name_A,
    Name_B,
    content AS ai_assessment
FROM ML.PREDICT(
    MODEL GeminiPro,
    (SELECT Name_A, Name_B, prompt FROM PairData)
);
```

**Expected output**:
```text
Name_A          | Name_B            | ai_assessment
----------------|-------------------|----------------
"David Chen"    | "Dr. Elena Frost" | "**Score: 9/10** Their compatibility is extremely high as David's practical, hands-on scavenging skills are perfectly complemented by Dr. Frost's specialized knowledge to identify critical medical supplies and avoid biological hazards."
```


>aside positive
>**How This Works**:
>
>**1. Build Prompts from Data**:
>```sql
>CONCAT("Assess compatibility...", "Survivor 1: ", s1.name, ...)
>```
>Result: `"Assess compatibility of these two survivors for a resource-gathering mission. Survivor 1: David Chen. Survivor 2: Dr. Elena Frost. Give a score from 1-10 and a 1-sentence reason."`
>
>**2. Send to Gemini**:
>```sql
>ML.PREDICT(MODEL GeminiPro, (SELECT prompt FROM PairData))
>```
>Spanner sends the prompt to Gemini API.
>
>**3. Gemini Generates Response**:
>```
>"**Score: 9/10** Their compatibility is extremely high as David's practical, 
>hands-on scavenging skills are perfectly complemented by Dr. Frost's specialized 
>knowledge to identify critical medical supplies and avoid biological hazards."
>```
>
>**4. Return as Column**:
>The generated text is returned as the `content` column.
>
>**Why In-Database LLM Calls?**
>- No need to export data to Python
>- Process data where it lives
>- Can scale to millions of rows (batch processing)

## 🚀 Building Your Graph RAG Agent with Hybrid Search
**Duration: 10 min**

### 1. System Architecture Overview



This section builds a **multi-method search system** that gives your agent flexibility to handle different types of queries. The system has three layers: **Agent Layer**, **Tool Layer**, **Service Layer**.

![architecture_hybrid_search](img/3_layer.png)


**Why Three Layers?**
- **Separation of concerns**: Agent focuses on intent, tools on interface, service on implementation
- **Flexibility**: Agent can force specific methods or let AI auto-route
- **Optimization**: Can skip expensive AI analysis when method is known

In this section, you'll primarily implement **semantic search (RAG)** - finding results by *meaning* not just keywords. Later, we'll explain how the **hybrid search** merges multiple methods.


### 2. RAG Service Implementation
👉💻 In the terminal, open the file in the Cloud Shell Editor by running:

```bash
cloudshell edit ~/way-back-home/level_2/backend/services/hybrid_search_service.py
```

Locate the comment `# TODO: REPLACE_SQL`

**Replace this whole line**  with the following code:


```python
        # This is your working query from the successful run!
        sql = """
            WITH query_embedding AS (
                SELECT embeddings.values AS val
                FROM ML.PREDICT(
                    MODEL TextEmbeddings,
                    (SELECT @query AS content)
                )
            )
            SELECT
                s.survivor_id,
                s.name AS survivor_name,
                s.biome,
                sk.skill_id,
                sk.name AS skill_name,
                sk.category,
                COSINE_DISTANCE(
                    sk.skill_embedding, 
                    (SELECT val FROM query_embedding)
                ) AS distance
            FROM Survivors s
            JOIN SurvivorHasSkill shs ON s.survivor_id = shs.survivor_id
            JOIN Skills sk ON shs.skill_id = sk.skill_id
            WHERE sk.skill_embedding IS NOT NULL
            ORDER BY distance ASC
            LIMIT @limit
        """
```

>aside positive
>**What This Query Does**:
>
>This is a **Graph RAG** query that combines two powerful techniques:
>1. **Graph Relationships** (via SQL JOINs on Spanner's graph tables)
>2. **Semantic Search** (via embeddings and `COSINE_DISTANCE`)
>
>
>**Wait, this is just SQL?** 
> 
>Yes! Spanner Graph lets you query graph relationships using **standard SQL** with `JOIN` statements. The graph structure (survivors → skills via `SurvivorHasSkill` edges) is stored in relational tables that you can join together. This is different from traditional graph databases that require specialized query languages like Cypher or Gremlin.

>aside positive
>**Why This Is "Graph RAG"**:
>- **Graph**: We're traversing relationships (survivor → skill) stored in the graph structure
>- **RAG**: We're using embeddings to retrieve semantically similar content (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
>- **Result**: Find survivors based on the *meaning* of skills they have, following graph connections
>
>**Example**: Query for "medic" → Finds survivors who have "Medical Training" or "First Aid" skills, even though "medic" doesn't appear in the database exactly.

### 3. Semantic Search Tool Definition
👉💻 In the terminal, open the file in the Cloud Shell Editor by running:

```bash
cloudshell edit ~/way-back-home/level_2/backend/agent/tools/hybrid_search_tools.py
```

In `hybrid_search_tools.py`, locate the comment `# TODO: REPLACE_SEMANTIC_SEARCH_TOOL`

👉**Replace this whole line**  with the following code:

```python
async def semantic_search(query: str, limit: int = 10) -> str:
    """
    Force semantic (RAG) search using embeddings.
    
    Use this when you specifically want to find things by MEANING,
    not just matching keywords. Great for:
    - Finding conceptually similar items
    - Handling vague or abstract queries
    - When exact terms are unknown
    
    Example: "healing abilities" will find "first aid", "surgery", 
    "herbalism" even though no keywords match exactly.
    
    Args:
        query: What you're looking for (describe the concept)
        limit: Maximum results
        
    Returns:
        Semantically similar results ranked by relevance
    """
    try:
        service = _get_service()
        result = service.smart_search(
            query, 
            force_method=SearchMethod.RAG,
            limit=limit
        )
        
        return _format_results(
            result["results"],
            result["analysis"],
            show_analysis=True
        )
        
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error in semantic search: {str(e)}"
```

**When Agent Uses**:
- Queries asking for similarity ("find similar to X")
- Conceptual queries ("healing abilities")
- When understanding meaning is critical

### 4. Agent Decision Guide (Instructions)

In agent definition, copy paste the semantic search related part to the instruction.

👉💻 In the terminal, open the file in the Cloud Shell Editor by running:

```bash
cloudshell edit ~/way-back-home/level_2/backend/agent/agent.py
```

The agent uses this instruction to select the right tool:

👉In `agent.py` file, locate the comment `# TODO: REPLACE_SEARCH_LOGIC`,
**Replace this whole line**  with the following code:

```python
- `semantic_search`: Force RAG/embedding search
  Use for: "Find similar to X", conceptual queries, unknown terminology
  Example: "Find skills related to healing"
```

👉Locate the comment `# TODO: ADD_SEARCH_TOOL`

```


### 5. Understanding How Hybrid Search Works (Read Only, No Action Needed)

In steps 2-4, you implemented **semantic search (RAG)**, the core search method that finds results by *meaning*. But you may have noticed the system is called "Hybrid Search". Here's how it all fits together:

>aside positive
>**The Three Search Methods Available**:
>
>1. **Semantic Search (RAG)** - What you just implemented
>   - Uses embeddings + `COSINE_DISTANCE`
>   - Best for: Conceptual queries, finding "similar to X"
>   - Example: "healing abilities" finds "first aid", "surgery", "herbalism"
>
>2. **Keyword Search** - Traditional SQL filtering
>   - Uses `LIKE` clauses and exact category matches  
>   - Best for: Specific filters like biome, category
>   - Example: "medical skills in forest" filters by category AND location
>
>3. **Hybrid Search** - Combines both methods
>   - Runs both searches and **merges results with weighted scores**
>   - Best for: Complex queries with both concepts AND filters
>   - Example: "Who can help with healing in the mountains?"


**How Hybrid Merge Works**:

In the file `way-back-home/level_2/backend/services/hybrid_search_service.py`, when `hybrid_search()` is called, the service runs BOTH searches and merges results:

```python
# Location: backend/services/hybrid_search_service.py

    rank_kw = keyword_ranks.get(surv_id, float('inf'))
    rank_rag = rag_ranks.get(surv_id, float('inf'))

    rrf_score = 0.0
    if rank_kw != float('inf'):
        rrf_score += 1.0 / (K + rank_kw)
    if rank_rag != float('inf'):
        rrf_score += 1.0 / (K + rank_rag)

    combined_score = rrf_score
```

>aside positive
>When `hybrid_search()` is called, the service runs BOTH searches and merges results using **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**.
>
>**What is RRF?**
>RRF is a standard algorithm for merging ranked lists from different search engines without needing to normalize their scores. It works by giving a score based on the *rank position* (1st, 2nd, 3rd) rather than the raw similarity score.
>
>
>**When Is Each Method Used?**
>
>The **agent** (`backend/agent/agent.py`) decides based on the query:
>
>| Query Type | Agent Chooses | Why |
>|------------|---------------|-----|
>| "Find survivors in forest" | `keyword_search` | Simple filter, no semantic needed |
>| "Who can fix injuries?" | `semantic_search` | Conceptual, needs meaning |
>| "Medical help in mountains" | `hybrid_search` | Has both concept + filter |

**For this codelab**, you implemented the **semantic search** component (RAG), which is the foundation. The keyword and hybrid methods are already implemented in the service - your agent can use all three!

Congratulations! You have successfully finished your Graph RAG Agent with hybrid search!

## 🚀 Testing Your Agent with ADK Web
**Duration: 5 min**

The easiest way to test your agent is using the `adk web` command, which launches your agent with a built-in chat interface.

### 1. Running the Agent

👉💻 Navigate to the backend directory (where your agent is defined) and launch the Web Interface::

```bash
cd ~/way-back-home/level_2/backend
uv run adk web
```

*This command starts the agent defined in `agent/agent.py` and opens a web interface for testing.*

👉 Open the URL:

The command will output a local URL (usually `http://127.0.0.1:8000` or similar). Open this in your browser.

![adk web](img/adk_web_ui.png)

Once you click on the URL, you will see the ADK Web UI. Make sure you select the "agent" from top left corner.

![adk_ui](img/adk_ui_test.png)

### 2. Testing Search Capabilities

The agent is designed to intelligently route your queries. Try the following inputs in the chat window to see different search methods in action.

#### 🧬 A. Graph RAG (Semantic Search)

*Finds items based on meaning and concept, even if keywords don't match.*

**Test Queries:** (Choose any of the below)
```bash
Who can help with injuries?
```

```bash
What abilities are related to survival?
```

**What to look for:**
- The reasoning should mention **Semantic** or **RAG** search.
- You should see results that are conceptually related (e.g., "Surgery" when asking for "First Aid").
- Results will have the 🧬 icon.

#### 🔀 B. Hybrid Search

*Combines keyword filters with semantic understanding for complex queries.*

**Test Queries:**(Choose any of the below)
```bash
Find someone who can ply a plane in the volcanic area
```
```bash
Who has healing abilities in the FOSSILIZED?
```
```bash
Who has healing abilities in the mountains?
```


**What to look for:**
- The reasoning should mention **Hybrid** search.
- Results should match BOTH criteria (concept + location/category).
- Results found by both methods will have the 🔀 icon and are ranked highest.

👉💻 When you finish testing, end the process by pressing `Ctrl+C` in your command line.

## 🚀 Running the Full Application
**Duration: 5 min**

**Full Stack Architecture Overview**

![architecture_fullstack](img/full_stack.png)

### Add SessionService & Runner
👉💻 In the terminal, open the file `chat.py` in the Cloud Shell Editor by running (make sure you did "ctrl+C" to end the previous process before proceeding):

```bash
cloudshell edit ~/way-back-home/level_2/backend/api/routes/chat.py
```

👉In `chat.py` file, locate the comment `# TODO: REPLACE_INMEMORY_SERVICES`,
**Replace this whole line** with the following code:
```python
    session_service = InMemorySessionService()
    memory_service = InMemoryMemoryService()
```

👉In `chat.py` file, locate the comment `# TODO: REPLACE_RUNNER`, 
**Replace this whole line** with the following code:
```python
runner = Runner(
    agent=root_agent, 
    session_service=session_service,
    memory_service=memory_service,
    app_name="survivor-network"
)
```

### 1. Start Application

If the previous terminal is still running, end it by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

👉💻 Start App:

```bash
cd ~/way-back-home/level_2/
./start_app.sh
```

When it successfully start backend, you will see `Local: http://localhost:5173/"` as below:
![fronted](img/frontend.png)

👉 Click **Local: http://localhost:5173/** from the terminal.

![conversation](img/move.gif)

### 2. Test Semantic Search

**Query**: 
```bash
Find skills similar to healing
```
![chat](img/chat_semantic_search.png)

**What happens**:
- Agent recognizes similarity request
- Generates embedding for "healing"
- Uses cosine distance to find semantically similar skills
- Returns: first aid (even though names don't match "healing")


### 3. Test Hybrid Search

**Query**: 
```bash
Find medical skills in the mountains
```

**What happens**:
1. **Keyword component**: Filter for `category='medical'`
2. **Semantic component**: Embed "medical" and rank by similarity
3. **Merge**: Combine results, prioritizing those found by both methods 🔀

**Query(optional)**: 
```bash
Who is good at survival and in the forest?
```

**What happens**:
- Keyword finds: `biome='forest'`
- Semantic finds: skills similar to "survival"
- Hybrid combines both for best results

👉💻 When you finish testing, in the terminal, end it by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

### 4. (!ONLY FOR WORKSHOP ATTENDEE) Update your location
👉💻 Run the completion script:

```bash
cd ~/way-back-home/level_2
./set_level_2.sh
```

> aside negative
> If you haven't attended workshop and finished level 0, you will see error message.

Now open `waybackhome.dev`, and you will see your location has updated. Congratulations on finishing level 2!

## ☕️ **[Optional]** Multimodal Pipeline (Read Only) — Tooling Layer
**Duration: 10 min**

### Why Do We Need a Multimodal Pipeline?

The survival network isn't just text. Survivors in the field send **unstructured data** directly through the chat:
- 📸 **Images**: Photos of resources, hazards, or equipment
- 🎥 **Videos**: Status reports or SOS broadcasts
- 📄 **Text**: Field notes or logs

>aside positive
>**The Challenge**: To make this data searchable ("Where is the water?"), we need to **extract structured entities** (Person, Resource, Location) from these files and save them to the graph.
>
>**Real-World Scenario**:
>> A user uploads a photo of a medical kit in the chat.
>> 
>> **The System Must**:
>> 1. Upload the file to GCS
>> 2. Use Gemini to "see" the medical kit
>> 3. Save a "Resource" node to Spanner
>> 4. Confirm to the user: "I saved the medical kit to the database."

---

### What Files Are We Processing?

Unlike the previous step where we searched existing data, here we process **User-Uploaded Files**. The `chat.py` interface handles file attachments dynamically:

| Source | Content | Goal |
|--------|---------|------|
| **User Attachment** | Image/Video/Text | Information to add to the graph |
| **Chat Context** | "Here is a photo of the supplies" | Intent and additional details |

---

### The Planned Approach: Sequential Agent Pipeline

We use a **Sequential Agent** (`multimedia_agent.py`) that chains specialized agents together:

![architecture_uploading](img/agent_diagram.png)

This is defined in `backend/agent/multimedia_agent.py` as a `SequentialAgent`.

---


The tooling layer provides the **capabilities** that agents can invoke. Tools handle the "how" — uploading files, extracting entities, and saving to the database.

### 1. Open the Tools File

👉💻 Open the file `level_2/backend/agent/tools/extraction_tools.py` or by typing the following command in terminal. Open a **new** terminal. In the terminal, open the file in the Cloud Shell Editor:

```bash
cloudshell edit ~/way-back-home/level_2/backend/agent/tools/extraction_tools.py
```

---

### 2. Implement `upload_media` Tool

This tool uploads a local file to Google Cloud Storage.

👉 In `def upload_media(file_path: str, survivor_id: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:`, the following code is about how to upload files to GCS detect its type:

```python
    """
    Upload media file to GCS and detect its type.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the local file
        survivor_id: Optional survivor ID to associate with upload
        
    Returns:
        Dict with gcs_uri, media_type, and status
    """
    try:
        if not file_path:
            return {"status": "error", "error": "No file path provided"}
        
        # Strip quotes if present
        file_path = file_path.strip().strip("'").strip('"')
        
        if not os.path.exists(file_path):
            return {"status": "error", "error": f"File not found: {file_path}"}
        
        gcs_uri, media_type, signed_url = gcs_service.upload_file(file_path, survivor_id)
        
        return {
            "status": "success",
            "gcs_uri": gcs_uri,
            "signed_url": signed_url,
            "media_type": media_type.value,
            "file_name": os.path.basename(file_path),
            "survivor_id": survivor_id
        }
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Upload failed: {e}")
        return {"status": "error", "error": str(e)}
```

---

### 3. Implement `extract_from_media` Tool

This tool is a **router** — it checks the `media_type` and dispatches to the correct extractor (text, image, or video).

👉 In `async def extract_from_media(gcs_uri: str, media_type: str, signed_url: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:`, the following code is about how to extract entities and relationships from uploaded media.


```python
    """
    Extract entities and relationships from uploaded media.
    
    Args:
        gcs_uri: GCS URI of the uploaded file
        media_type: Type of media (text/image/video)
        signed_url: Optional signed URL for public/temporary access
        
    Returns:
        Dict with extraction results
    """
    try:
        if not gcs_uri:
             return {"status": "error", "error": "No GCS URI provided"}

        # Select appropriate extractor
        if media_type == MediaType.TEXT.value or media_type == "text":
            result = await text_extractor.extract(gcs_uri)
        elif media_type == MediaType.IMAGE.value or media_type == "image":
            result = await image_extractor.extract(gcs_uri)
        elif media_type == MediaType.VIDEO.value or media_type == "video":
            result = await video_extractor.extract(gcs_uri)
        else:
            return {"status": "error", "error": f"Unsupported media type: {media_type}"}
            
        # Inject signed URL into broadcast info if present
        if signed_url:
            if not result.broadcast_info:
                result.broadcast_info = {}
            result.broadcast_info['thumbnail_url'] = signed_url
        
        return {
            "status": "success",
            "extraction_result": result.to_dict(), # Return valid JSON dict instead of object
            "summary": result.summary,
            "entities_count": len(result.entities),
            "relationships_count": len(result.relationships),
            "entities": [e.to_dict() for e in result.entities],
            "relationships": [r.to_dict() for r in result.relationships]
        }
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Extraction failed: {e}")
        return {"status": "error", "error": str(e)}
```

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **Multimodal Input**: We pass both the **text prompt** (`_get_extraction_prompt()`) and the **image object** to `generate_content`.
- **Structured Output**: `response_mime_type="application/json"` ensures the LLM returns valid JSON, which is critical for the pipeline.
- **Visual Entity Linking**: The prompt includes known entities so Gemini can recognize specific characters.

---

### 4. Implement `save_to_spanner` Tool

This tool persists the extracted entities and relationships to Spanner Graph DB.

👉 In `def save_to_spanner(extraction_result: Any, survivor_id: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:`, the following code is about how to save extracted entities and relationships to Spanner Graph DB.

```python
    """
    Save extracted entities and relationships to Spanner Graph DB.
    
    Args:
        extraction_result: ExtractionResult object (or dict from previous step if passed as dict)
        survivor_id: Optional survivor ID to associate with the broadcast
        
    Returns:
        Dict with save statistics
    """
    try:
        # Handle if extraction_result is passed as the wrapper dict from extract_from_media
        result_obj = extraction_result
        if isinstance(extraction_result, dict) and 'extraction_result' in extraction_result:
             result_obj = extraction_result['extraction_result']
        
        # If result_obj is a dict (from to_dict()), reconstruct it
        if isinstance(result_obj, dict):
            from extractors.base_extractor import ExtractionResult
            result_obj = ExtractionResult.from_dict(result_obj)
        
        if not result_obj:
            return {"status": "error", "error": "No extraction result provided"}
            
        stats = spanner_service.save_extraction_result(result_obj, survivor_id)
        
        return {
            "status": "success",
            "entities_created": stats['entities_created'],
            "entities_existing": stats['entities_found_existing'],
            "relationships_created": stats['relationships_created'],
            "broadcast_id": stats['broadcast_id'],
            "errors": stats['errors'] if stats['errors'] else None
        }
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Spanner save failed: {e}")
        return {"status": "error", "error": str(e)}
```

By giving agents high-level tools, we ensure **data integrity** while leveraging the agent's reasoning capabilities.

---

### 5. Update GCS Service

The `GCSService` handles the actual file upload to Google Cloud Storage.

👉💻 Open the file `level_2/backend/services/gcs_service.py`, or you can type in the terminal to open the file in the Cloud Shell Editor:

```bash
cloudshell edit ~/way-back-home/level_2/backend/services/gcs_service.py
```

👉 In `def upload_file(self, file_path: str, survivor_id: Optional[str] = None) -> Tuple[str, MediaType, str]:`, the following code is about how to save extracted entities and relationships to Spanner Graph DB.

```python
        blob = self.bucket.blob(blob_name)
        blob.upload_from_filename(file_path)
```

By abstracting this into a service, the Agent doesn't need to know about GCS buckets, blob names, or signed URL generation. It just asks to "upload".

---

### 6. Why Agentic Workflow > Traditional Approaches?

>aside positive
>
>There are two traditional ways to build this pipeline. Both have major drawbacks that the **Agentic Workflow** solves.
>
>---
>
>#### ❌ **Approach 1: Batch Data Pipeline** (Simple but Brittle)
>
>A typical batch script that processes files sequentially:
>
>```python
># Traditional batch pipeline
>for file in ["broadcast_1.txt", "broadcast_2.png", "broadcast_3.mp4"]:
>    gcs_uri = upload_to_gcs(file)        # Fails if file corrupted → CRASH
>    entities = extract_entities(gcs_uri) # No error handling
>    save_to_db(entities)                 # Saves even if extraction empty → WASTE
>    # How do you tell the user progress? Print to console?
>```
>
>**Problems:**
>- ❌ **No Adaptability**: If one file fails, the whole script crashes
>- ❌ **No Context**: Can't adjust behavior based on user intent ("This is urgent!")
>- ❌ **Silent Failures**: Errors hidden in logs, user has no idea what happened
>- ❌ **No User Feedback**: Script runs in background, user waits blindly
>
>---
>
>#### ❌ **Approach 2: Event-Driven Architecture** (Cloud-Native but Complex)
>
>Traditional cloud setup:
>1. User uploads to GCS
>2. GCS Event triggers Cloud Function
>3. Function calls Vision API
>4. Function writes to DB
>5. ...How do we tell the user it finished? (Need WebSockets/Polling)
>
>**Problems:**
>- ❌ **High Complexity**: Manage 5+ services (GCS, Eventarc, Cloud Functions, Pub/Sub...)
>- ❌ **Decoupled State**: Hard to pass data between event handlers
>- ❌ **Debugging Nightmare**: Logs scattered across multiple services
>- ❌ **Disconnected from User**: Events run in background, no conversation context
>
>---
>
>#### ✅ **Our Approach: Agentic Sequential Pipeline**
>
>The `multimedia_agent.py` uses a **SequentialAgent** that orchestrates the pipeline intelligently:
>
>```python
># Agentic pipeline (simplified conceptual view)
>Agent: "I'll upload your file..."
>Tool: upload_media → Success ✅
>Agent: "Great! Now extracting entities..."
>Tool: extract_from_media → Found 3 survivors, 2 resources ✅
>Agent: "Perfect! Saving to database..."
>Tool: save_to_spanner → Saved as broadcast #456 ✅
>Agent: "Done! I found 3 survivors and 2 resources in your image. Saved to the graph."
>```
>
**The Agentic Advantage:**

| Feature | Batch Pipeline | Event-Driven | **Agentic Workflow** |
|---------|----------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Complexity** | Low (1 script) | High (5+ services) | **Low** (1 Python file: `multimedia_agent.py`) |
| **State Management** | Global variables | Hard (decoupled) | **Unified** (Agent state) |
| **Error Handling** | Crashes | Silent logs | **Interactive** ("I couldn't read that file") |
| **User Feedback** | Console prints | Need polling | **Immediate** (Part of chat) |
| **Adaptability** | Fixed logic | Rigid functions | **Intelligent** (LLM decides next step) |
| **Context Awareness** | None | None | **Full** (Knows user intent) |

>aside positive
>**Real-World Example:**
>
>**Batch Script**: 
>```
>Processing file 1... Done.
>Processing file 2... ERROR: Corrupted image
>[CRASH - User has to restart entire batch]
>```
>
>**Agentic Workflow**:
>```
>User: "Here are 3 images of our supply cache"
>Agent: "Processing image 1... Found medical supplies ✅"
>Agent: "Processing image 2... This file seems corrupted. Skipping. ⚠️"
>Agent: "Processing image 3... Found food supplies ✅"
>Agent: "Summary: I successfully processed 2 of 3 images. Would you like to re-upload image 2?"
>```

**Why This Matters:**
By using `multimedia_agent.py` (a SequentialAgent with 4 sub-agents: Upload → Extract → Save → Summary), we replace complex infrastructure AND fragile scripts with **intelligent, conversational application logic**.

---

## ☕️ **[Optional]** Multimodal Pipeline (Read Only) — Agent Layer
**Duration: 8 min**

The agent layer defines the **intelligence** — agents that use tools to accomplish tasks. Each agent has a specific role and passes context to the next. Below is architecture diagram for multiagent system.

![agent_diagram](img/upload_pipeline.png)

### 1. Open the Agent File

👉💻 Open the file `level_2/backend/agent/multimedia_agent.py` or by typing the following command in terminal. Open a **new** terminal. In the terminal, open the file in the Cloud Shell Editor:

```bash
cloudshell edit ~/way-back-home/level_2/backend/agent/multimedia_agent.py
```

---

### 2. Define the Upload Agent

This agent extracts a file path from the user's message and uploads it to GCS.

👉In the file `multimedia_agent.py`, with the following code, it creates `upload_agent` that uploading to GCS:

```python
upload_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="UploadAgent",
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    instruction="""Extract the file path from the user's message and upload it.

Use `upload_media(file_path, survivor_id)` to upload the file.
The survivor_id is optional - include it if the user mentions a specific survivor (e.g., "survivor Sarah" -> "Sarah").
If the user provides a path like "/path/to/file", use that.

Return the upload result with gcs_uri and media_type.""",
    tools=[upload_media],
    output_key="upload_result"
)
```

---

### 3. Define the Extraction Agent

This agent "sees" the uploaded media and extracts structured data using Gemini Vision.

👉In the file `multimedia_agent.py`, with the following code，it creates `extraction_agent` that extract information from the uploaded media:

```python
extraction_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="ExtractionAgent", 
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    instruction="""Extract information from the uploaded media.

Previous step result: {upload_result}

Use `extract_from_media(gcs_uri, media_type, signed_url)` with the values from the upload result.
The gcs_uri is in upload_result['gcs_uri'], media_type in upload_result['media_type'], and signed_url in upload_result['signed_url'].

Return the extraction results including entities and relationships found.""",
    tools=[extract_from_media],
    output_key="extraction_result"
)
```

Notice how the `instruction` references `{upload_result}` — this is how **state is passed** between agents in ADK.

---

### 4. Define the Spanner Agent

This agent saves the extracted entities and relationships to the graph database.

👉In the file `multimedia_agent.py`, with the following code，it creates `spanner_agent` that Save the extracted information to the database:

```python
spanner_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="SpannerAgent",
    model="gemini-2.5-flash", 
    instruction="""Save the extracted information to the database.

Upload result: {upload_result}
Extraction result: {extraction_result}

Use `save_to_spanner(extraction_result, survivor_id)` to save to Spanner.
Pass the WHOLE `extraction_result` object/dict from the previous step.
Include survivor_id if it was provided in the upload step.

Return the save statistics.""",
    tools=[save_to_spanner],
    output_key="spanner_result"
)
```

This agent receives context from **both** previous steps (`upload_result` and `extraction_result`).

---

### 5. Define the Summary Agent

This agent synthesizes results from all previous steps into a user-friendly response.

👉In the file `multimedia_agent.py`, with the following code, it defines the prompt for `summary_agent` that summarize the result:

```python
USE_MEMORY_BANK = os.getenv("USE_MEMORY_BANK", "false").lower() == "true"
save_msg = "6. Mention that the data is also being synced to the memory bank." if USE_MEMORY_BANK else ""

summary_instruction = f"""Provide a user-friendly summary of the media processing.

Upload: {{upload_result}}
Extraction: {{extraction_result}}
Database: {{spanner_result}}

Summarize:
1. What file was processed (name and type)
2. Key information extracted (survivors, skills, needs, resources found) - list names and counts
3. Relationships identified
4. What was saved to the database (broadcast ID, number of entities)
5. Any issues encountered
{save_msg}

Be concise but informative."""
```

This agent doesn't need tools — it just reads the shared context and generates a clean summary for the user.

---

### 🧠 Architecture Summary

| Layer | File | Responsibility |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **Tooling** | `extraction_tools.py` + `gcs_service.py` | **How** — Upload, extract, save |
| **Agent** | `multimedia_agent.py` | **What** — Orchestrate the pipeline |
---

## 🚀 Multimodal Data Pipeline — Orchestration
**Duration: 5 min**

The core of our new system is the `MultimediaExtractionPipeline` defined in `backend/agent/multimedia_agent.py`. It uses the **Sequential Agent** pattern from the ADK (Agent Development Kit).

### 1. Why Sequential?

Processing an upload is a linear dependency chain:
1. You cannot extract data until you have the file (Upload).
2. You cannot save data until you extract it (Extraction).
3. You cannot summarize until you have the results (Save).

A `SequentialAgent` is perfect for this. It passes the output of one agent as the context/input to the next.

### 2. The Agent Definition

Let's look at how the pipeline is assembled at the bottom of `multimedia_agent.py`:
👉💻 In the terminal, open the file in the Cloud Shell Editor by running:

```bash
cloudshell edit ~/way-back-home/level_2/backend/agent/multimedia_agent.py
```

It receives inputs from *both* previous steps.
Locate the comment `# TODO: REPLACE_ORCHESTRATION`.
**Replace this whole line**  with the following code:
```python
    sub_agents=[upload_agent, extraction_agent, spanner_agent, summary_agent]
```

### 3. Connect with Root Agent
👉💻 In the terminal, open the file in the Cloud Shell Editor by running:

```bash
cloudshell edit ~/way-back-home/level_2/backend/agent/agent.py
```

Locate the comment `# TODO: REPLACE_ADD_SUBAGENT`.
**Replace this whole line**  with the following code:
```python
    sub_agents=[multimedia_agent],
```

This single object effectively bundles four "experts" into one callable entity.

### 4. Data Flow Between Agents

Each agent stores its output in a shared **context** that subsequent agents can access:

### 5. Open application (skip if app is still running)
> aside negative
> if your previous app process is still open, you can skip this step.

👉💻 Start App:

```bash
cd ~/way-back-home/level_2/
./start_app.sh
```

👉 Click **Local: http://localhost:5173/** from the terminal.

### 6. Test Image Upload

👉 In the chat interface, choose any of the photo here and upload to the UI:


- [test_photo1](https://storage.googleapis.com/waybackhome_test/test1.png),

- [test_photo2](https://storage.googleapis.com/waybackhome_test/test2.png),

- [test_photo3](https://storage.googleapis.com/waybackhome_test/test3.png),

- [test_photo4](https://storage.googleapis.com/waybackhome_test/test4.png)

In the chat interface, tell the agent about your specific context:

```bash
Here is the survivor note
```
And then attach the image here.

![upload_input](img/upload_input.png)


![upload_result](img/upload.gif)

👉💻 In the terminal, when you finished testing, press "Ctrl+C" to end the process.

  s.name AS Survivor,
  s.role AS Role,
  b.name AS Biome,
  r.name AS FoundResource,
  s.created_at
FROM Survivors s
LEFT JOIN SurvivorInBiome sib ON s.survivor_id = sib.survivor_id
LEFT JOIN Biomes b ON sib.biome_id = b.biome_id
LEFT JOIN SurvivorFoundResource sfr ON s.survivor_id = sfr.survivor_id
LEFT JOIN Resources r ON sfr.resource_id = r.resource_id
ORDER BY s.created_at DESC;
```

## ☕️ **[Optional]** Memory Bank with Agent Engine
**Duration: 5 min**

### 1. How Memory Works

The system uses a dual-memory approach to handle both immediate context and long-term learning.

![memory_bank](img/memory_bank.png)

### 2. What Are Memory Topics?

**Memory Topics** define the *categories* of information the agent should remember across conversations. Think of them as filing cabinets for different types of user preferences.

>aside positive
>**Why Not Just One Big Memory?**
>- ❌ **Generic memory**: "User said something about searching... and needs... and biomes..."
>- ✅ **Organized topics**: Clear separation between search behavior vs. urgent monitoring

**Our 2 Topics:**

1. **`search_preferences`**: How the user likes to search
   - Do they prefer keyword or semantic search?
   - What skills/biomes do they search for often?
   - Example memory: "User prefers semantic search for medical skills"

2. **`urgent_needs_context`**: What crises they're tracking
   - What resources are they monitoring?
   - Which survivors are they concerned about?
   - Example memory: "User is tracking medicine shortage in Northern Camp"

>aside positive
>**Why 2 Topics?**
>- **Precision**: The LLM can extract facts into the correct category
>- **Retrieval**: When the user asks "Find survivors with medical skills", the agent recalls from `search_preferences`, not unrelated urgent needs data
>- **Scalability**: You can add more topics later (e.g., `favorite_survivors`, `alliance_tracking`)
>
>**How It Works:**
>When you chat with the agent, the Memory Bank automatically extracts facts that match these topic descriptions and saves them. Next time you start a new session, the agent retrieves relevant memories to personalize responses.

---

### 3. Setting Up Memory Topics
Custom memory topics define *what* the agent should remember. These are configured when deploying the Agent Engine.

👉💻 In the terminal, open the file in the Cloud Shell Editor by running:
```bash
cloudshell edit ~/way-back-home/level_2/backend/deploy_agent.py
```
This opens `~/way-back-home/level_2/backend/deploy_agent.py` in your editor.


We define structure `MemoryTopic` objects to guide the LLM on what information to extract and save.

👉In the file `deploy_agent.py`, replace the `# TODO: SET_UP_TOPIC` with the following:

```python
# backend/deploy_agent.py

    custom_topics = [
        # Topic 1: Survivor Search Preferences
        MemoryTopic(
            custom_memory_topic=CustomMemoryTopic(
                label="search_preferences",
                description="""Extract the user's preferences for how they search for survivors. Include:
                - Preferred search methods (keyword, semantic, direct lookup)
                - Common filters used (biome, role, status)
                - Specific skills they value or frequently look for
                - Geographic areas of interest (e.g., "forest biome", "mountain outpost")
                
                Example: "User prefers semantic search for finding similar skills."
                Example: "User frequently checks for survivors in the Swamp Biome."
                """,
            )
        ),
        # Topic 2: Urgent Needs Context
        MemoryTopic(
            custom_memory_topic=CustomMemoryTopic(
                label="urgent_needs_context",
                description="""Track the user's focus on urgent needs and resource shortages. Include:
                - Specific resources they are monitoring (food, medicine, ammo)
                - Critical situations they are tracking
                - Survivors they are particularly concerned about
                
                Example: "User is monitoring the medicine shortage in the Northern Camp."
                Example: "User is looking for a doctor for the injured survivors."
                """,
            )
        )
    ]

```


### 4. Agent Integration

The agent code must be aware of the Memory Bank to save and retrieve information.

👉💻 In the terminal, open the file in the Cloud Shell Editor by running:

```bash
cloudshell edit ~/way-back-home/level_2/backend/agent/agent.py
```
This opens `~/way-back-home/level_2/backend/agent/agent.py` in your editor.


#### Agent Creation

When creating the agent, we pass the `after_agent_callback` to ensure sessions are saved to memory after interactions.
The `add_session_to_memory` function runs asynchronously to avoid slowing down the chat response.

👉In the file `agent.py`, locate the comment `# TODO: REPLACE_ADD_SESSION_MEMORY`,
**Replace this whole line**  with the following code:
```python
async def add_session_to_memory(
        callback_context: CallbackContext
) -> Optional[types.Content]:
    """Automatically save completed sessions to memory bank in the background"""
    if hasattr(callback_context, "_invocation_context"):
        invocation_context = callback_context._invocation_context
        if invocation_context.memory_service:
            # Use create_task to run this in the background without blocking the response
            asyncio.create_task(
                invocation_context.memory_service.add_session_to_memory(
                    invocation_context.session
                )
            )
            logger.info("Scheduled session save to memory bank in background")
```

#### Background Saving

👉In the file `agent.py`, locate the comment `# TODO: REPLACE_ADD_MEMORY_BANK_TOOL`,
**Replace this whole line**  with the following code:
```python
if USE_MEMORY_BANK:
    agent_tools.append(PreloadMemoryTool())
```

👉In the file `agent.py`, locate the comment `# TODO: REPLACE_ADD_CALLBACK`,
**Replace this whole line**  with the following code:
```python
    after_agent_callback=add_session_to_memory if USE_MEMORY_BANK else None
```

### Set Up Vertex AI Session Service
👉💻 In the terminal, open the file `chat.py` in the Cloud Shell Editor by running:

```bash
cloudshell edit ~/way-back-home/level_2/backend/api/routes/chat.py
```

👉In `chat.py` file, locate the comment `# TODO: REPLACE_VERTEXAI_SERVICES`,
**Replace this whole line** with the following code:
```python
    session_service = VertexAiSessionService(
        project=project_id,
        location=location,
        agent_engine_id=agent_engine_id
    )
    memory_service = VertexAiMemoryBankService(
        project=project_id,
        location=location,
        agent_engine_id=agent_engine_id
    )
```

## ☕️ **[Optional]** Attach Agent with Agent Engine

### 1. Setup & Deployment

Before testing the memory features, you need to deploy the agent with the new memory topics and ensure your environment is configured correctly.

We have provided a convenience script to handle this process.

#### Running the Deployment Script

👉💻 In the terminal, run the deployment script:

```bash
cd ~/way-back-home/level_2
./deploy_and_update_env.sh
```

This script performs the following actions:
- Runs `backend/deploy_agent.py` to register the agent and memory topics with Vertex AI.
- Captures the new **Agent Engine ID**.
- Automatically updates your `.env` file with `AGENT_ENGINE_ID`.
- Ensures `USE_MEMORY_BANK=TRUE` is set in your `.env` file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you make changes to `custom_topics` in `deploy_agent.py`, you must re-run this script to update the Agent Engine.

---

### Verify Memory Bank
Now you can verify that the memory bank is working by teaching the agent a preference and checking if it persists across sessions.

### Step One. Open the application 
Open the Application again by following the instruction below:
If the previous terminal is still running, end it by pressing `Ctrls+C`.

👉💻 Start App:

```bash
cd ~/way-back-home/level_2/
./start_app.sh
```

👉 Click **Local: http://localhost:5173/** from the terminal.


### Step Two. Testing Memory Bank with Text

In the chat interface, tell the agent about your specific context:

```bash
"I'm planning a medical rescue mission in the mountains. I need survivors with first aid and climbing skills."
```

👉 **Wait ~30 seconds** for the memory to process in the background.

### Step Three. Start a New Session

Refresh the page to clear the current conversation history (short-term memory).

Ask a question that relies on the context you provided earlier:

```bash
"What kind of missions am I interested in?"
```

**Expected Response**:
> "Based on your previous conversations, you're interested in:
> - Medical rescue missions
> - Mountain/high-altitude operations
> - Skills needed: first aid, climbing
>
> Would you like me to find survivors matching these criteria?"

### Step Four. Test with Image Upload

Upload an image, and ask:

```bash
remember this
```

You can choose any of the photo here or your own and upload to the UI:
- [test_photo1](https://storage.googleapis.com/waybackhome_test/test1.png),

- [test_photo2](https://storage.googleapis.com/waybackhome_test/test2.png),

- [test_photo3](https://storage.googleapis.com/waybackhome_test/test3.png),

- [test_photo4](https://storage.googleapis.com/waybackhome_test/test4.png)

### Step Five. Verify in Vertex AI Agent Engine

Go to [Google Cloud Console Agent Engine](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/agents/agent-engines)

1. Make sure you select the project from top left project selector:

   ![project selector](img/select_project.png)

2. Verify the agent engine you just deployed from previous command `use_memory_bank.sh`:

   ![agent engine](img/agent_engine_1.png)

   Click into the agent engine you just created.

3. Click the **`Memories`** Tab in this deployed agent, you can view all the memory here.

   ![view memory](img/agent_engine_2.png)

👉💻 When you finish testing, in you terminal, click "Ctrl + C" to end the process.

🎉 **Congratulations!** You just attached the memory bank to your agent!

---

## ☕️ **[Optional]** Deploy to Cloud Run
**Duration: 5 min**

### 1. Run the Deployment Script

👉💻 Run the deployment script:

```bash
cd ~/way-back-home/level_2
./deploy_cloud_run.sh
```

After it successfully deployed, you will have the url, this is deployed url for you!
![deployed](img/deployed.png)


👉💻 Before you grab the url, grant the permission by running:
```bash
source .env && gcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding survivor-frontend --region $REGION --member=allUsers --role=roles/run.invoker && gcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding survivor-backend --region $REGION --member=allUsers --role=roles/run.invoker
```

Go to the deployed url, and you will see you application live there!

### 2. Understanding the Build Pipeline

The `cloudbuild.yaml` file defines the following sequential steps:

1. **Backend Build**: Builds the Docker image from `backend/Dockerfile`.
2. **Backend Deploy**: Deploys the backend container to Cloud Run.
3. **Capture URL**: Gets the new Backend URL.
4. **Frontend Build**: 
   - Installs dependencies.
   - Builds the React app, injecting `VITE_API_URL=<backend_url>`.
5. **Frontend Image**: Builds the Docker image from `frontend/Dockerfile` (packaging the static assets).
6. **Frontend Deploy**: Deploys the frontend container.



### 3. Verify Deployment

Once the build completes (check the logs link provided by the script), you can verify:

1. Go to the [Cloud Run Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/run).
2. Find the `survivor-frontend` service.
3. Click the URL to open the application.
4. Perform a search query to ensure the frontend can talk to the backend.

### (OPTIONAL) 4. Manual Deployment

If you prefer to run the commands manually or understand the process better, here is how to use `cloudbuild.yaml` directly.

#### Writing `cloudbuild.yaml`

A `cloudbuild.yaml` file tells Google Cloud Build what steps to execute.
- **steps**: A list of sequential actions. Each step runs in a container (e.g., `docker`, `gcloud`, `node`, `bash`).
- **substitutions**: Variables that can be passed at build time (e.g., `$_REGION`).
- **workspace**: A shared directory where steps can share files (like how we share `backend_url.txt`).

#### Running the Deployment 

To deploy manually without the script, use the `gcloud builds submit` command. You MUST pass the required substitution variables.

```bash
# Load your env vars first or replace these values manually
export PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
export REGION=us-central1

gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml \
    --project "$PROJECT_ID" \
    --substitutions _REGION="us-central1",_GOOGLE_API_KEY="",_AGENT_ENGINE_ID="your-agent-id",_USE_MEMORY_BANK="TRUE",_GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI="TRUE"
```
